## Monthly Report for `r params$Facility`

Find attached your performance report for the month ending June 30th 2023.

## Monthly Performance

See attached your performance on your number of clients for each service type.

```{r sales_plot, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warnings=FALSE,fig.cap=paste('Number of Clients Plot for',params$Facility), fig.height=4, fig.width=6}

library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
#load data
facility_data=read.csv("sample facility data.csv", stringsAsFactors = T)
# Generate ggplot2 sales plot based on agent-specific data

facility_filter=facility_data |>
  filter(Facility == params$Facility)

plot_filename <- glue::glue("{params$Facility}_sales_plot.png")
ggsave(plot_filename, ggplot(facility_filter, aes(x = Service_Type, y = Clients)) +
         geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#631ae6") +
         labs(x = 'Service Type', y = 'Number of Clients'))

# Include the figure in the report
knitr::include_graphics(plot_filename)
```

## Conclusion

We need to increase the average number of clients by service type.
